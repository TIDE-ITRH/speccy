This package is still a work in progress. It is an attempt to normalise much of the existing spectral analysis tools, as well as collating recent methodologies from the debiased spectral estimation literature. Code is currently demonstrated across a few notebooks that will eventually form the contents of a readthedocs help page.

* 01 - shows how to use the bochner function to intentionally bias spectral estimates
* 02 - shows the [debiased Whittle likelihood](https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article/106/2/251/5318578)
* 03 - shows the [debiased Welch estimator](https://arxiv.org/html/2312.13643v1)

Currently, these are only minimal working examples. We will be expanding examples and documentation shortly.
